# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to work with and document a library of media.

* Block Device Images: Dumps of the block device with [`ddrescue`](https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/) and other metadata.
  * [USB drives](docs/usb-drives.md): `ddrescue` dump and output from `lsusb` as well as pictures of the devices themselves.
  * [Memory cards](docs/memory-cards.md): I don't have serial numbers for these.  The best I can do is pictures and descriptions of the cards.
  * [Zip disks](docs/zip-disks.md): Includes pictures and decriptions of the disks.
  * [Hard drives](docs/hard-drives.md): Includes pictures of the drives as well as `smartctl -x` and `hdparm` output.
* Analog Audio/Video
  * [VHS tapes](docs/vhs-tapes.md): These are a work in progress.  I have a giant pile of VHS tapes and wish to digitize them.
  * [Microcassettes](docs/microcassettes.md): These are low-quality mono recordings from an answering machine or portable recorder.
  * [Compact cassettes](docs/cassettes.md): These are mostly stuff recorded off the radio.
* Other
  * [Scanned paper documents](docs/scans.md): Large numbers of PDFs and perhaps a few other files that were scanned using a [Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/peripheral/scanners/scansnap/ix500/) and other devices.
  * [Optical media](docs/optical.md): Images of CDs, DVDs, and other optical media.  For most of these, the top surface of the disc was scanned at high resolution.
  * [Floppy disks](docs/floppy-disks.md): Images acquired using a few different techniques including the normal floppy drive controller or a [SuperCard Pro](https://www.cbmstuff.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=52) device.  Includes available metadata.
